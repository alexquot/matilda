### Hi there!
#### About
Matilda is a kinda Material theme for Bootstrap 4. The goals of
this project are to provide a theme that looks similar to Material
Guidelines, but not to overdose it with complexity. There's a need
for a simple but beautiful Bootstrap themes, I want to keep
everything in a single CSS file. So, no JS plugins at all.

Currently it's in early stage development, but one can find it's
quite usable already.

#### Build
```
npm install
npm run { build, watch, lint }
```

#### Helping the project
It would be nice to see any activity in project's GitHub page.
Feel free to fill issues and create pull requests.
